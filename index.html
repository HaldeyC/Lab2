                  My name in Cay Haldey. I am almost 50 years old. I'm not new to computers but I'm pretty new
                  to web development. I have a special memory I like to share. When i was around 8-10 years
                  old I got my first computer. Still remember the model, a Commandore VIC-20. It was not much
                  of a computer if you compair to todays PC's but you could play games on them. The first game
                  I play was "City Bomber". You started the game by pushing in a cartridge in the VIC-20 and
                  flipped the power switch. The game started and a little plane flew from left to right. You
                  pressed the spacebar to drop a bombs on the buildings so the buildings got destroyed. Once
                  all the buildings were destroyed you could land the plane and win the game. This was a very
                  long time ago, but it is still a good memory to me.

                  How I got interested in web development? That started a long time ago. Actually long before
                  Google was in the picture. I tried it out when Netscape Navigator still was a thing. I
                  thought it was to difficult to do anything and really didn't understand anything. I got my
                  hands on a program that help to do small stuff, but the computer I had was to bad so I
                  couldn't do much. Just a lot of lag. I stopped even trying. I started doing network stuff
                  instead. Took a course in network managenment, this was back in
                  <time datetime="1997">1997</time> or something like that. To make a long story short, that
                  didn't work out for me. Started doing alot of other kind of jobs, until like 2-3 years ago,
                  I got my interest back again. Started watching alot of Youtube tutorials. I started to try
                  coding again, and this time some stuff really made sense. Applied to differant schools to
                  get some better knowledge. Luckily I got in to Kristianstad University. So now I am learning
                  and evolving in this field.

            <h2>Future Goals</h2>
            <div>
               <p>
                  In the future I would like to work as an freelancer in this area of expertice. I would like
                  to keep my current job as a Service and Operation manager but be able to gradually go over
                  to web development full-time. Learning about HTML, CSS and JavaScript is very fun and I'm
                  starting to view website differantly now then from before. Starting to analyze each page I
                  visit now and I'm trying to understand how each page are built. I am really excited and
                  looking forward to this furture. The reason I want to learn web development is of a simple
                  reason, you can work from home and you can work from anywhere in the world. One wise person
                  once said, when you work for someone you work for their dreams. But when you work for
                  yourself you work for your dreams. That's why I chose this path, I want to be able to work
                  for my own dreams in the future.
